### TLDR

#### The truth

Most of programming is really just taking data from place A, transforming it, and putting it in place B.

90% of real-world programs are database frontends, held by duct tape.

The internet is just a collection of people making todo lists i.e. CRUD apps. Almost everything on the internet is some database getting inserts, updates, reads and deletes.
